\section{Introduction}
	

Recently, several sim-to-real algorithms have come out that are based on image-to-image translation. [Citations]
These are used for training robots using pixel-based reinforcement learning.
They demonstrated that better image translation algorithms yielded notable improvements in robotic benchmarks.
At the same time, there is a lot of research on differentiable rendering,
a topic which produced papers such as NERF which attempt to capture 3d representations of the real world.
However, most of these approaches are either supervised or involve only camera movements [citations].
One paper that came out recently combined both image translation and differentiable rendering in an unsupervised manner to create view-consistent models of human organs [citation].
This paper too, though, was limited to only camera movements.

This algorithm unlocks a new capability: learning textures to match photos for given 3d models without supervision.

The motivation for this paper is to create a temporally consistent sim-to-real image translation algorithm that will look the same from multiple camera angles simultaneously, keeps all semantic details 
[[I'll finish this later... let's work on the meat of the paper first...]]

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=200pt]{../images/dataset_explanation.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		Compatible datasets have two sets of images: a set of UVL scenes and a set of photographs.
		TRITON is a sim-to-real image translation algorithm, taking in synthetic UVL scenes and aiming to create realistic fake photographs. 
		Being an unsupervised algorithm, there are no correspondences between synthetic and real images.
		In this dataset, three alphabet cubes are moved around the table. 
		The synthetic and rear cameras have the same position and field of view.
		There are many more UVL scenes than photos because synthetic scenes can be generated automatically whereas photos require real-world labor.
		}
	\label{fig:dataset_explanation}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=270pt]{../images/uvl_explanation.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		This diagram shows the purpose of a UVL image.
		A UVL scene is an image that has three channels: RGB.
		R and G are used for U and V, and B is used for L.
		L stands for Label, and determines which part of the synthetic image will get which texture.
		The U and V coordinates correspond to positions on each texture,
		telling it how to project the textures onto the 3d objects represented in the UVL scene.
		The darkest shade of blue corresponds to the 1st texture, and the next darkest shade of blue corresponds to the 2nd texture etc.
		}
	\label{fig:uvl_explanation}
\end{figure}

In this paper, we'll mostly focus on a hand-collected dataset that involves three alphabet blocks that are moved across a table.
Alphabet blocks were chosen because they all have the same geometry (a cube), but have very distinct semantic textures that will make temporal inconsistency obvious to the human eye.
This dataset is analogous to data that would be collected for a third-person robotic grasping task.
However, other objects (such as cans of soda, apples, cloves of garlic, etc) are also for generating other results in this paper. ((TODO: Detail the five object tests and five cube tests and other stuff like shiny cans etc)).

There are two components to this dataset: Simulated data in the form of UVL scenes, and photographs.
The camera in the simulation is positioned in approximately the same place as the real camera, with approximately the same field of view.
In both domains of this dataset, the camera never moves. Instead, the objects are randomly positioned and rotated on the table.
In both the simulation and in real life, these objects are randomly translated along the x and y-axis of the table, as well as rotated on the z-axis.

There are 200 photographs in this dataset, and they are recorded as RGB jpg images.
There are 3000 synthetic images in this dataset, in the form of UVL images.
These UVL images are also encoded as RGB images, but provide information about the geometry of a scene.
UVL images are composed of both a UV map and a label map and are summarized in figure \ref{fig:uvl_explanation}.
To avoid positional rounding errors, UVL images are encoded as EXR files: an image format that supports floating-point values.

The pixels in a UVL image are visualizable in RGB space because, like RGB images, each pixel is a vector with 3 values. The first two channels, U and V, are floating point values between 0 and 1. The L channel is also a floating point value between 0 and 1, it has a second meaning. There are only a finite number of label values (corresponding to the number of learnable textures). The rank of a particular L value is used to index these textures.

In the three-cube dataset we have 4 textures, and UVL scenes contain label values $l \in [\frac{0}{3}, \frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{3}]$. A pixel in a UVL scene $l=\frac{2}{3}$ will get indexed to the third texture, because $\frac{2}{3}$ is the third smallest label value.

\subsection{Neural Texture}

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=400pt]{../images/learnable_textures.pdf}
		\end{center}
		\caption{
			This figure illustrates how the neural textures are calculated in figure \ref{fig:main_diagram}. They are fully differentiable, and represented continuously along the texture's U and V axes using fourier feature networks.
		}
		% For each texture, there is a separate Fourier feature network (Fourier features fed into a pixel-wise MLP) that will take in Fourier features as inputs, and output an RGB image using the method described in \citet{fourier_feature_networks}.
		% We found this method gave better results than storing each differentiable texture as a raster matrix of pixels, as well as being faster to train.
		% During inference, you can store the results of this MLP as a raster image of arbitrarily large resolution, saving both time and VRAM.
		\label{fig:learnable_textures}
	\end{figure}

	$B$ is the batch size. Given a batch of $B$ UVL Scenes $s_{1\dots B}$ with $L$ different label values, we project $L$ different neural textures $\tau_{1\dots L}$ onto that scene; obtaining projections $\tau_{1\dots B}$. This projection mechanism is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:uvl_explanation}.

	These neural textures are not stored in raster form during training. Instead, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:learnable_textures}, they're paramaterized by a pixel-wise fourier feature network \cite{fourier_feature_networks} that takes in UV coordinates and returns RGB colors. During inference, however, these textures are rasterized to save both time and video memory.
	
	Each neural texture $\tau_i$ is a function consisting of two components: a multi-layer perceptron $M_i$ and a static set of 256 random spatial frequencies $f_{1...256}$. 
	Given a two-dimensional $uv$ vector, the spatial frequencies are used to generate a high dimensional embedding used as input for the MLP.
	\makebox[\textwidth]
	{
		$
		\tau_i(uv) = 
		\
		M_i\left(\left[
			\sin f_1 uv, \ 
			\cos f_1 uv, \ 
			\sin f_2 uv, \ 
			\cos f_2 uv, \ 
			\dots \ 
			\sin f_{256} uv, \ 
			\cos f_{256} uv \ 
		\right]\right)
		$
	}
	where $uv$ and $f_i \in N_{ormal}(\mu=0,\ \sigma=10)$ are two dimensional vectors,
	 $f_i uv$ represents their dot product, 
	%  $rgb$ represents a 3d color vector,
	 and $M_i$ maps a $uv$ embedding to an $rgb$ color value:
	 $M_i: \mathbb{R}^{256} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$.
	Note that there is nothing special about 256 or 10: these hyperparameter values just happen to work nicely.
	
	A particular neural texture $\tau_i$ uses maps $uv \rightarrow rgb$. Similarly, the set of textures $\tau_{1\dots L}$ maps uvl values to rgb values: $\tau_{1\dots L}(uvl)=\tau_l(uv)$ where $uvl$ is the concatenation of a $uv$ vector with a label $l \in 1\dots L$.
	
	In practice, we found that TRITON learns faster with fourier-feature textures than raster textures. The trained fourier-feature textures also exhibit less noise than its raster counterparts. We think this is because they don't suffer as much from aliasing artifacts in the UV maps, where the loss gradient might skip over pixels in texture-space when the UVL scene is zoomed out too far or raster resolution is too high. Case in point: if you have a raster texture with very high resolution, the loss gradient is less likely to be passed to a given texel because the chance that a given UV value in a scene will be rounded to that pixel's coordinates is very small.

	% We use a separate MLP for every texture. 



\subsection{Image Translation}
Our image translation module $T$ is based on the image translation module used in \citep{surgical_video_translation}, which is a variant of MUNIT \cite{munit}. Like in \citep{surgical_video_translation} but unlike MUNIT, however, the style code is fixed and noise is injected into the latent codes to prevent overfitting. During inference, our image translation module is completely determinstic.

$T$ is a bidirectional image translation module, and has two translation directions. $T_{A\rightarrow B}$ translates sim to real (aka domain A to domain B), and $T_{B\rightarrow A}$ translates real to sim (aka domain B to domain A). The simulation domain A (UVL maps concatenated to their texture projections) has 6 channels, whereas the real image domain B (photographs) has 3 channels.

Apart from these differences, the losses pertaining directly to image translation are the same as that in MUNIT. 

Due to the way MUNIT works, we define
$T_{A\rightarrow B}\left(c\right) = dec_B\left(enc_A\left(c\right)\right)$
and 
$T_{B\rightarrow A}\left(p\right) = dec_A\left(enc_B\left(p\right)\right)$
where $enc_A, enc_B, dec_A, dec_B$ are encoders and decoders for domains A and B respectively, $p$ is a batch of real photos, and $c$ is a batch of simulated UVL+projection concatenations.




\subsection{Unprojection Consistency Loss}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=400pt]{../images/unprojection_consistency_loss.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		This is the unprojection consistency loss used in figure \ref{fig:main_diagram}.
		After calculating fake photos $\hat{p}_{1...B}$ from UVL scenes $s_{1...B}$ as seen in figure \ref{fig:main_diagram}, 
		we can unproject fake photos $\hat{p}_{1...B}$ back into texture space to obtain $u_{1...B,\ 1...L}$ .
		If the fake photos display consistent textures along their 3d surfaces, then the unprojected textures should be similar.
		We can measure this similarity by taking the per-channel standard deviation of these unprojections, aka $\sigma(u)$, then averaging the result.
		When the fake photos display similar surfaces, the unprojections will be similar making the unprojection consistency loss low.
		Additionally, we can also calculate the average unprojection, which is useful for visualization purposes (it will look blurry if $\hat{p}$ is inconsistent).
	}
	\label{fig:unprojection_consistency_loss}
\end{figure}

This benefits from large batch sizes, but that often makes you run out of vram.

Also, you have to get lucky - two scene pictures have to show the same side of a cube for example. First person scenarios would be even worse.

Also, the resolution of the unprojection matters:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=400pt]{../images/unprojection_resolution_comparison.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		The resolution of an unprojection matters for unprojection consistency loss. The larger it is, the more precise the alignment will be but the less likely a given UV value is to be assigned a loss greater than 0, lowering numerical instability.
	}
	\label{fig:unprojection_resolution_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Texture Realism Loss}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=250pt]{../images/texture_realism_ablation.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		The neural texture looks more realistic with texture realism loss enabled.
	}
	\label{fig:texture_realism_ablation}
\end{figure}

These images could be regularized so that they're the same every time.

To do this we put a penalty on the latent texture that makes it $\pi$ look like its translation $\hat{p}$. 

We use L2 and MSSSIM losses to do this.

This helps improve the translations.

There's a good reason for this: it's almost equivalent to unprojection consistency.
In fact, it can even be used on its own without unprojection consistency loss (both are sufficient to translate things.)

(Give theoretical explation)

There are some advantages over unprojection consistency though: 
smaller batch sizes (even a batch size of 1, which UC cant do),
you don't have to get lucky (the more chaotic, or even the more zoomed in a dataset becomes the less likely there is to be any collisions)






\subsection{Color Loss}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=400pt]{../images/frame_inconsistency_diagram.pdf}
	\end{center}

	% Each outline color corresponds to the same cube.
	% The same cubes are marked with the same colored outlines across all photos.
	% For the same cube, we expect to see the same number on the top of the cube regardless of its placement.
	
	\caption{
		Each row of images shows a different random placement of objects in the scene.
		Each column of images is a different image translation algorithm.
		The same cube is marked with the same color outline across all photos.
		TRITON is consistent: for example, the cube outlined as yellow always has an 8 on the top.
		Meanwhile, CycleGan for example shows a 4 on the top of that cube in the top two rows, but an 8 and a 7 in the next two rows.
		Because of the symmetry of the cubes, and the unsupervised training, it is arbitrary which synthetic cube gets which symbol after training - but whatever it chooses, it should be consistent between placements.
		CUT and CycleGan are not consistent, while TRITON is.
		% TODO: Update the images in this to have the latest training iteration...

\section{Limitaions}
\label{sec:Limitations} 

Can't handle transparent objects. 
A limited number of objects can be learned at once before supervision is necessary with color loss (but there are workarounds).
Takes a long time to train.
