	Unpaired image translation algorithms can be used for sim-to-real tasks, but most fail to generate temporally consistent results.
	% Because of this, the details or even identity of a particular object might change as it moves across a scene.
	We present a new approach that combines differential rendering with image translation to achieve temporal consistency over indefinite timescales.

	We call this algorithm TRITON (Texture Recovering Image Translation Network): an unsupervised, end-to-end, stateless sim-to-real algorithm that 
	leverages the underlying 3d geometry of input scenes by generating realistic-looking learnable neural textures.

	% These textures are projected onto the surfaces of input scenes, which are then fed through an image translation network to obtain the final outputs.
	By settling on a particular albedo for the objects in a scene, we ensure consistency between frames statelessly.
	Unlike previous algorithms, TRITON is not limited to camera movements - it can handle the movement of objects as well, making it useful for downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation.
	Our experiments show that in addition to achieving higher temporal consistency, the translations are closer to ground truth photographs than previous techniques.

\section{Introduction}
	
	Recently, several sim to real algorithms have come out that are based on image to image translation. [Citations]
	These are used for training robots using pixel-based reinforcement learning.
	They demonstrated that better image translation algorithms yielded notable improvements in robotic benchmarks.
	At the same time, there is a lot of research on differentiable rendering,
		a topic which produced papers such as NERF which attempt to capture 3d representations of the real world.
	However, most of these approaches are either supervised or involve only camera movements [citations].
	One paper that came out recently combined both image translation and differentiable rendering in an unsupervised manner to create view-consistent models of human organs [citation].
	This paper too, though, was limited to only camera movements.
	
	The motivation for this paper is to create a temporally consistent sim-to-real image translation algorithm that will look the same from multiple camera angles simultaneuously, keeps all semantic details 
	[[I'll finish this later...lets work on the meat of the paper first...]]

\label{sec:citations}

	Citations can be made using either \textbackslash citep\{\} or \textbackslash citet\{\}, depending from the appropriateness. To avoid the citation moving to the next line, it is often a good practice to replace the space before with a tilde (\~{}) character.
	Example 1: ``CoRL is the best conference ever~\citep{Gauss1857}.''
	Example 2: ``\citet{Gauss1857} proved, both theoretically and numerically, that CoRL is the best conference ever.''
